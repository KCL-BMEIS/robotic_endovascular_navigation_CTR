# Hardware
The hardware components provided include the bill of materials to replicate the robotic hardward as well as the required .stl files for 3D-printing.

# Software
The software component is found "robotic_control.py". It serves as a basic user interface, letting the user control the robot's translation and rotation with a standard USB keyboard.
